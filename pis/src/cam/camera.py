# Ideas:
#   -   Manual calibration? Using buttons on the app,
#       as this only has to be done once (probably)
#       First set minimum (ibidi slide side), then navigate and set maximum
#       Maybe move in increments at every button press? e.g 10 or 100 steps
# 
#   -   Store min/max in file
#       (get at startup, store after calibration)
#
#   -   Store current position in file (get at startup and store after moving)
#       Perhaps store this in persistent database?
#       In case retained mqtt message isn't good/reliable enough
#       
#       If I rely on local storage, maybe publish min/max/current
#       to broker on startup/changes?
#
# Todo:
#   - Test to see how far back I can go with microscope
#
